    <h2>About Kathy</h2>
    <p>I love books. If I could eat them, I would. I love their scent and often put my nose in to inhale their aroma. The first book I owned was The Secret Of Pooduck Island, given to me by a dear family friend, Alphonse Gerwing, a man who later went on to accept the Order of Canada medal. That book today remains a prized possession.</p>
